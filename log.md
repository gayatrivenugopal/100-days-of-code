# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: August 10, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Extracted sentences from an existing coorpus of Hindi text and built my own

**Thoughts:** Happy to have used Spyder for the first time instead of Jupyter Notebook for this particular task as it was getting stuck for some reason.
